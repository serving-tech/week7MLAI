# AI Ethics and Theoretical Understanding

## Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

### Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.

**Definition:**  
Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and unfair discrimination in the outcomes of AI systems, often resulting from biased training data, model design, or assumptions made during development.

**Examples:**

1. **Hiring Algorithms:**  
   An AI used for resume screening may favor male candidates over female ones if it's trained on past hiring data that reflect historical gender biases.

2. **Facial Recognition:**  
   Some facial recognition systems perform poorly on individuals with darker skin tones because the training data had an overrepresentation of lighter-skinned individuals.

### Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?

**Transparency:**  
Refers to the openness about how an AI system is developed, how it works, and what data it uses. It means stakeholders can see into the system’s structure and processes.

**Explainability:**  
Refers to the ability of an AI system to provide understandable reasons for its decisions or predictions to human users.

**Importance:**

- **Transparency** builds trust by making the system's workings open to scrutiny and regulation.
- **Explainability** ensures accountability by enabling users and developers to understand, challenge, or correct AI decisions—especially in high-stakes areas like healthcare or criminal justice.

### Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?

GDPR impacts AI development in the EU by enforcing:

- **Data Protection by Design and Default:**  
  AI systems must be built to safeguard personal data.

- **Right to Explanation:**  
  Individuals have the right to understand how automated decisions are made about them.

- **Consent and Lawful Basis:**  
  AI systems must obtain clear, lawful consent to process personal data.

- **Data Minimization and Accuracy:**  
  Only necessary data can be collected, and it must be accurate and up to date.

These rules encourage ethical AI design but also impose constraints that developers must carefully navigate.

## Part 2: Ethical Principles Matching

| Principle        | Definition                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **A) Justice**        | Fair distribution of AI benefits and risks.              |
| **B) Non-maleficence** | Ensuring AI does not harm individuals or society.        |
| **C) Autonomy**        | Respecting users’ right to control their data and decisions. |
| **D) Sustainability**  | Designing AI to be environmentally friendly.             |
